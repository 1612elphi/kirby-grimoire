Teleporting six people had proved a minor mistake, Abby thought when Riley and her were overcame with an overwhelming sense of nausea, made only worse by the smell of the dumpster between Murphy's General Store and the Keystone Quick Cash.

"Oh god" Abby mumbled and held her stomach as she leaned against the side of the building.

"You good?" Marigold asked, rubbing her hands together in anticipation of having to help out with her power. "Need a boost?"

"I'm okay" Abby said and adjusted her glasses. "I just need a moment."

"Here." Jacob said and offered her a bottle of water from his backpack. "Have some." Abby nodded and had a sip. 

"Thanks."

Keystone had been completely transformed. What used to be a sleepy tourist town just the day before had turned into a fairground, drenched in Americana. The road was blocked, strings of Edison lights and pennants were criss-crossing between the two sides of the street. Carnival music was playing, coming from the far end of the road, where it split to lead out of the town or up to the Northern hotel.

"Wow." Marigold said and walked out onto the main road. "They really pulled out all the stops."

Autumn wanted to follow her, but Riley held her back. "Autumn. Don't float." 

"I... hate walking." She said, quietly. "Touching the ground feels... weird."

Riley took her hand and squeezed it. "I'm here, okay?"

---

The closer they got to the fairground, the thicker the air became with the smell of funnel cakes, popcorn, and the faint tang of the diesel fuel powering the rides. Laughter and chatter mingled with the distant sounds of a tilt-a-whirl ride, warped slightly by the wind. Snow-dusted pines framed the scene, along with a few winter-themed decorations - plastic snowmen, tinsel garlands, though the festive chaos made it feel more like a summer carnival than a winter fair.

"This is... amazing." Abby breathed, and her eyes glowed with excitement. "We never had this in SF."

Autumn was still gripping Riley's hand, grimacing as her boots scuffed against the muddy paving. "It's loud. I don't like it," she muttered, her voice barely audible over the din. She glanced up, as if tempted to just float half an inch off the ground, just a little bit.

"You'll get used to it" Riley said and squeezed her hand a little tighter. "Stick with me, right? We'll find something fun to do together."

Sadie didn't relax an iota. She scanned the fairground, arms crossed, expression unreadable. "No powers, we agreed. We're just normal kids tonight."

"Got it, boss" Abby grinned and saluted. "No superpowers." She handed the water bottle back to Jacob. "Thanks."

He took it back. "So what's the plan? Do we split up, or-"

"We should split up! I wanna try *everything* here." Marigold said, for once not sniffling or sneezing. It was as if she'd become a completely different person. Sadie smiled faintly, just enough for Abby to notice.

"Pairs at least" she said. "And keep your eyes open for anything weird. Geologists."

---

They naturally fell into groups. Riley and Autumn stayed near the entrance, watching for USGS jackets, before eventually wandering off towards the craft stalls. Marigold dragged Sadie towards the food stalls, only Jake and Abby walked through the main thoroughfare, towards the game booths, where bells and people in horrible outfits promised prizes for skill, luck or some combination of the two. 

"Oh, look, a tilt-a-whirl" Jacob said and pointed at a large ride a few booths over. "You ever been on one?"

Abby shook her head. She still hadn't fully recovered from the teleport, and just looking at the spinning cars whirling around the track made her a little sick. "Never." 

"They're actually fascinating." He pointed at one of the cars, tracing their motion. "They don't actually rotate on their own, it's the offset weight of the riders that causes the central axis to turn into a complex chaotic system. They're mathematically unpredictable."

Abby was only partially listening. A faint prickling at her neck was distracting her. She couldn't place it, but if she had to guess, she'd've said someone was watching her. Looking over her shoulder, her eyes glanced through the sea of faces - families, teens, vendors - but nobody stood out.

"Kautz and Huggard actually came up with a quite beautiful equation that approximates the motion of the cars. It's not perfect, of course, and there's a few variances they don't account for, but it got them published in the American Journal of Physics." He went on.

"You wanna ride it?"

"God, no." he laughed. "You wanna make my brain explode?"

"Well, I wanna do something." Abby glanced over at the booths with the carnival games. "Ring toss?"

"Most of them are rigged" he said, matter-of-factly. "Odds for the ring toss are maybe 12%? If you're lucky. And considering your track record of falling out of the sky and almost going splat, well, I wouldn't put money on you."

"All right, all right. Darts?"

"Better," he said and approached the stand, handing the guy in the horribly gaudy outfit behind it a quarter. "Dull darts, underinflated balloons. I can make this work."

"You think you can win me the penguin?" Abby asked and pointed to a large stuffed penguin hung up on the side wall. 

"Probably" he said, and his irises glowed faintly. He threw the dart, the balloon in the middle burst with a satisfying pop. Another one, and another one, then the one on the corner. Four for four.

The carnie, thoroughly unimpressed, handed over the plush. It was almost as large as Abby's torso, and she- there it was again. Stronger this time. She was being watched.

She turned, scanning the crowd again. A flash of long white hair, a glimpse of a pale face near a stand selling candied fruit, but then nothing. "Did you see that?"

"See what?" Jacob followed her gaze. "USGS?"

"No, no, a... girl, I think. White hair. She was right there."

Jacob squinted into the crowd, but nobody matching that description was anywhere to be found. Just a swirl of people and sugar-scented air. "Don't see anyone like that. You sure?"

"I... maybe not." Abby shook her head, clutching the penguin a little tighter. The unease lingered. "Let's just keep moving."

Riley and Autumn strolled past the craft booths. Surprisingly, for a small town like Keystone, there were a surprising number of local artists - as in, more than one. 

Autumn paused at a display of crystal pendants, considering a shimmering amethyst on a necklace. "Pretty," she said softly.

"Do you want it?" Riley asked, reaching for her wallet.

"No, no, it's okay" Autumn said and put it down. "Just looking."

Riley smiled and put her wallet back in her pocket. "Suit yourself."

As they wandered, Riley kept her ears open, sifting through the chatter for anything useful. Most of it was mundane and uninteresting - kids begging for more ride tickets, vendors haggling over prices - but then, near a heated tent, she caught a familiar voice. "Dave is losing his mind. And I'm considering insanity too." She glanced over, and there sat Dr. Allen Truman, opposite a woman in her fifties with short black hair, two beers in front of them.

She froze, grabbing Autumn's arm. "Stop. Wait."

"What?" She replied, but stopped as Riley said.

Riley stepped behind the tent, where nobody could see them. "My dad's in there."

"What?! He's here?"

"Yes! I recognise his voice, and I think I saw him out of the corner-"

"Ssh, just listen." Autumn said, and they both tried to make out the voices through the opaque canvas wall of the tent..

"Are you sure you're fit for this?" A woman's voice asked. "I'm asking this as a friend, Allen. Not your boss, not your peer, a friend."

"And do what, go back to SF? No, this is..." He sighed. "It's all I have left."

"You hear anything from the police about Riley?"

"Nothing since Tahoe." A pause. "I just pray she's alive. This damn mountain, I'm telling you."

"Look, I know it must be... strange to be back here."

"Do you know how little I've been sleeping?" Dr. Truman asked and put down his glass. "Minutes. An hour if I'm lucky. If I'm not worrying about where my daughter has run off to, thinking I want to put her in jail, I'm having nightmares about this godforsaken place."

"Allen, I'm serious. You don't have to be here. Dave has-"

"Have you *seen* his notes? Dave is going insane. He's not doing this alone."

She didn't answer.

"Come on, let's finish up here and go back to the Northern."

"You don't want to-"

"I want to go to bed, Marlene."

Riley and Autumn heard the sounds of shuffling, and a few moments later, Riley's dad and his boss were gone. Riley let out a breath she didn't realise she'd been holding, and Autumn held her hand again. "Come on, let's find something less depressing."

At the food stalls, Marigold was in paradise. She’d already demolished a fried Oreo and was now gnawing on a turkey leg as big as her forearm. “Sadie, look!” she exclaimed, waving the greasy drumstick. “It’s huge!”

Sadie managed a small smile, leaning against a lemonade stand. “You're not a vegetarian?”

"Are you kidding? Plants are my buddies." She answered, mouth full.

Marigold beamed and darted back to the vendor for a second helping, leaving Sadie to watch the crowd. The lights, the music, the laughter - it was hard not to relax, just a little. But she couldn't afford to let her guard down. If the USGS was picking up readings again, how long until they traced it back to the camp?

A hand on her shoulder jolted her out of her thoughts. “Hey, you okay?” Marigold was back, turkey leg in one hand, concern in her eyes.

“Yeah, just... thinking,” Sadie said, forcing a smile.

Marigold studied her, then held out the turkey leg. “Bite? It’s really good.”

Sadie laughed and took a small nibble. “Okay, you win. It’s good.”

“See?” Marigold grinned. “Fun, right?”

“Yeah,” Sadie admitted, her tension easing. “It is.”

"So, the rings are definitely too light." Jacob said and handed it back to Abby. "Plus, the heater in the booth has a fan. That's gonna throw off your trajectory by at least fifteen degrees, and-"

Abby wasn't listening. She was being watched again, stronger than ever this time. Her eyes darted to the crowd. There it was again, a flash of white hair, vanishing behind a popcorn stand. She dropped the rings on the counter and bolted after it.

"Abby, wait!" Jacob called, but Abby was already weaving through the crowd. Abby rounded the stand, heart pounding, expecting to come face to face with the girl with the white hair, but... nothing. Just a discarded candy apple stick rolling in the breeze.

"God damn it."

Jacob caught up, breathless. "What was that?"

"I saw her again." Abby's voice was shaky. "She was right here."

He scanned the area quickly, doubtful. "There's no one-"

Abby snapped. "I *know* what I saw!" She shook her head, her voice softened. "Sorry. I just... I can feel it, Jake. She's watching us."

He put a hand on her arm, steady but gentle. “Maybe it’s just the crowd. After everything, it’s easy to get jumpy.”

Abby wanted to believe him, but her gut screamed otherwise. Before she could argue, a loudspeaker crackled: “Ladies and gentlemen, the fireworks start in ten minutes! Head to the viewing area!”

“Come on,” Jacob said, steering her back toward the main street. “Let’s find the others.”

---

The group gathered near the middle of the fairgrounds, where a tall Christmas tree had been placed. Riley and Autumn stood sipping cider, while Marigold and Sadie approached, Mari still gnawing at her turkey leg. Abby and Jacob trailed behind, Abby’s face pale, her penguin plush hugged tightly to her chest.

“Fireworks are starting soon,” Marigold said, her voice bright despite the subtle tension rippling through the group.

Riley glanced around, her mind buzzing with an idea. “Hey, why don’t we get a better view? I could teleport us to the roof of the Northern. It’s high enough to see everything. The fair, the fireworks, even the mountain.”

Sadie hesitated, her brow furrowing. “Teleporting? Here? What if someone notices?”

“It’ll be quick,” Riley reassured her. “No one’s looking up at the roof, and it’s probably empty anyway.”

“Yeah, come on, Sadie,” Jacob chimed in. “The view will be worth it.”

Marigold nodded eagerly. “Please? It sounds amazing.”

Sadie sighed, her resistance crumbling. “Alright, but make it fast.”

Riley grinned. “Everyone hold hands.”

The group linked up, forming a tight circle. Riley closed her eyes, picturing the Northern Hotel’s rooftop in her mind. A brief sensation of vertigo swept over them, the world shimmering and shifting. When they opened their eyes, they were standing on the flat roof, the fairgrounds sprawling below like a patchwork of light and color.

“Holy crap,” Marigold whispered, stepping toward the edge. “This is incredible.”

The vantage point was stunning. Below, the fair twinkled with life - booths glowed with warm hues, the rides spun, and tiny figures milled about. Beyond the fair, Mount Rushmore’s carved faces stared into the night. The first firework rocketed skyward, exploding into a cascade of red and gold that reflected off the rooftops.

Abby barely noticed the display. A familiar chill crept up her spine again, that unshakable feeling of being watched. She edged closer to the railing, her eyes sweeping the crowd below.

Then she saw her.

At the far edge of the fairgrounds stood the girl, her white-grey hair shimmering faintly under the fireworks’ glow. She was staring up at the roof, staring at Abby. Their eyes met, and for a fleeting moment, Abby caught a hint of a smile, subtle and cryptic. Another firework burst, flooding the scene with blue light, and when the shadows settled, the girl was gone, swallowed by the darkness.

Abby’s heart thudded. She gripped the railing, torn between teleporting down to pursue her and staying put. But she knew it was pointless. The girl had vanished.

“Abby?” Jacob’s voice broke through her thoughts. He was beside her now, his tone laced with worry. “What’s wrong?”

She blinked, forcing her gaze away from the empty spot below. “Nothing,” she said, her voice unsteady. “Just… thought I saw something.”

He frowned, following her line of sight. “Did you see her again?”

“Never mind. It's nothing.” she repeated, managing a weak smile. “Let’s just watch the fireworks.”

The sky continued to erupt in bursts of color, but Abby’s mind was elsewhere. That girl - whoever she was - knew they were here. 

---

Darkness had long fallen when the group materialised back in the clearing, Riley and Abby's joint teleport dropping them gently into the stillness of the forest air, far away from the chaos of the Keystone fairground. The air was sharp with pine and frost. Abby's mind still lingered on the fleeing glimpses of the strange girl - her white hair, her silent presence, though she couldn't say why.

"That was fun!" Marigold said and started to climb up the rope ladder. 

"Yeah." Sadie replied, yawning. "Good idea, Abby."

Nods and murmurs followed, and they trudged toward their treehouses, boots crunching faintly in the snow. Abby climbed the ladder to SF house, her limbs heavy but her mind restless. Inside, Riley was already in her bunk, her father’s notebook splayed across her chest. Abby kicked off her shoes and collapsed into her own bed, too tired to change. The treehouse creaked softly as night settled in, with wind through the pines, the distant hoot of an owl.

Sleep came quickly. Wrapped up in her soft blankets, Abby was too tired to think more about the fair. The gentle rock of the treehouse in the winter air put her in a tight sleep, and she dreamed about the fairground. She was on top of a giant ferris wheel, much larger than the small one they had actually had. She was on the top, looking down onto the crowd, scanning for the girl. She was nowhere to be found. 

Then, the ferris feel rolled forwards. It crashed through the booths, pulverising them, with Abby barely holding onto to her little cabin as it tore through the field, leaving only destruction in its wake. Wood splintered, twigs cracked-

Abby jolted awake, her heart slamming against her ribs. She lay still, ears straining. The forest had gone quiet, its usual chorus swallowed by an oppressive hush. Slowly, she slid out of bed, the wooden floor cold against her bare feet, and crept to the window. The snap of the twig had been real.

The clearing below glowed under a too-bright moon, the snow casting an unearthly sheen. Shadows stretched long and wrong, like fingers clawing at the light. And there, in the center, stood the girl.

Her white hair shimmered, catching the moonlight in a way that didn’t make sense, as if it drank the glow rather than reflect it. Her dark coat melted into the edges of the night, but her face - pale, still, almost porcelain - tilted upward, her eyes locked on Abby’s. They pierced through the distance, unblinking, holding a weight Abby couldn’t name. 

"Abby?" Riley mumbled from her bed. "What's going on?"

Abby could not take her eyes off the girl. Not again. Not when she disappeared half a dozen times before. Instead, she whispered.

"Someone followed us here."
