Back when I was maybe 13 years old, I was a member of the online writing site Wattpad. It's where I wrote and read a lot of the stuff I'd cringe at nowadays, but it was a nonetheless a part of my childhood that I wouldn't want to have taken from me.

I read a lot of middling fiction, badly thought out plots and premises, threadbare characters and atrocious fan fiction. Of course, I loved all of it.

One piece however stuck with me. It was called Two To Teleport, and it was about two teens - Allegra and Riley - that discovered they could teleport and subsequently ran away from their home in San Francisco.

The book was never finished. It stopped after Chapter 6, which was just when the plot started to spin up. It's been on my mind ever since.

A decade later, I remembered it. I used all the arcane tricks in my arsenal to recover an archived version of this unfinished draft, and subsequently tried my hardest to find the people who wrote it. Dozens of web searches, several phone books and scanned attendance lists from universities later, I found them.

I reached out, explained what I wanted to do. To take the premise and finish it. Give it closure. After all, I am a quarter of a century old now. I should have some closure with this unfinished part of my childhood. They agreed to let me write my interpretation of the premise. It's what turned into this novel.

I hope I did it justice.
