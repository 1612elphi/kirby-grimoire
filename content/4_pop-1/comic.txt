Blurb:

Bridget Estrin was supposed to be the perfect student, a brilliant programmer - eight years of training to refactor boot-sector code for solar panels on the edge of nowhere. But when the path everyone planned for you stops making sense, sometimes the only choice is to drift.

Quitting her assignment at Theotech EdgeLabs, Bridget hitches a ride on the Pequod, a porter vessel bound for the World Unity, along with her captain Enid Marin. With no real place to call home and no vision but her own, she sets course across the galaxy, seeking something that can't be plotted on any star chart: the answer to who she is when nobody's telling her who to be.
