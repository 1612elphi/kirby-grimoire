TODO FOR GRIMOIRE V2

1. Add a property to the comic-page file blueprint to mark a page as the first of a new chapter. This should then break - or visually mark somehow - the end and start of a new chapter in the page list on the comic.php blueprint.
2. Add a property to both book.yml and comic.yml to mark a work as SFW, NSFW or NSFL, which unblurs, blurs, or blurs with a confirmation step to view respecitvely on the main front page
3. make both book.php and comic.php templates responsive.
